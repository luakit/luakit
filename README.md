# Luakit

luakit is a fast, light and simple to use micro-browser framework exensible
by Lua using the WebKit web content engine and the GTK+ toolkit.

## Dont Panic!

You don't have to be a developer to use luakit on a daily basis. If you are
familiar with vimperator, pentadactyl, jumanji, uzbl & etc you will find
luakit behaves similarly out of the box.

## Requirements

 * gtk2
 * Lua (5.1)
 * lfs (lua file system)
 * libwebkit (webkit-gtk)
 * libunique
 * sqlite3

## Compiling

To compile the stock luakit run:

    make

To link against LuaJIT (if you have LuaJIT installed) run:

    make USE_LUAJIT=1

To build without libunique (which uses dbus) run:

    make USE_UNIQUE=0

To build with a custom compiler run:

    make CC=clang

Note to packagers: you may wish to build luakit with:

    make DEVELOPMENT_PATHS=0

To prevent luakit searching in relative paths (`./config` & `./lib`) for
user configs.

The `USE_LUAJIT=1`, `USE_UNIQUE=0`, `PREFIX=/path`, `DEVELOPMENT_PATHS=0`,
`CC=clang` build options do not conflict. You can use whichever you desire.

## Installing

To install luakit run:

    sudo make install

The luakit binary will be installed at:

    /usr/local/bin/luakit

And configs to:

    /etc/xdg/luakit/

And the luakit libraries to:

    /usr/local/share/luakit/lib/

To change the install prefix you will need to re-compile luakit (after a
`make clean`) with the following option:

    make PREFIX=/usr
    sudo make PREFIX=/usr install

## Use Luakit

Just run:

    luakit [URI..]

Or to see the full list of luakit launch options run:

    luakit -h

## Configuration

The configuration options are endless, the entire browser is constructed by
the config files present in `/etc/xdg/luakit`

There are several files of interest:

 * rc.lua      -- is the main config file which dictates which and in what
                  order different parts of the browser are loaded.
 * binds.lua   -- defines every action the browser takes when you press a
                  button or combination of buttons (even mouse buttons,
                  direction key, etc) and the browser commands (I.e.
                  `:quit`, `:restart`, `:open`, `:lua <code>`, etc).
 * theme.lua   -- change fonts and colours used by the interface widgets.
 * window.lua  -- is responsible for building the luakit browser window and
                  defining several helper methods (I.e. `w:new_tab(uri)`,
                  `w:close_tab()`, `w:close_win()`, etc).
 * webview.lua -- is a wrapper around the webview widget object and is
                  responsible for watching webview signals (I.e. "key-press",
                  "load-status", "resource-request-starting", etc). This file
                  also provides several window methods which operate on the
                  current webview tab (I.e. `w:reload()`,
                  `w:eval_js("code here..")`, `w:back()`, `w:forward()`).
 * modes.lua   -- manages the modal aspect of the browser and the actions
                  that occur when switching modes.
 * globals.lua -- change global options like scroll/zoom step, default
                  window size, useragent, search engines, etc.

Just copy the files you wish to change (and the rc.lua) into
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/luakit` (defaults to `~/.config/luakit/`) and luakit will
use those files when you next launch it.

## Uninstall

To delete luakit from your system run:

    sudo make uninstall

If you installed with a custom prefix remember to add the identical prefix
here also, example:

    sudo make PREFIX=/usr uninstall
