luakit (2017.08.10) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Yuriy Melnyk ]
  * Allow user to configure whether to ignore case in follow mode or not
  * Wrap follow_js into function so that it returns null instead of object.
    This fixes #151

  [ Peter Hofmann ]
  * Fixed compiler warning regarding ncol.

  [ Mason Larobina ]
  * Check new cookie host not null
  * Persistent follow not working (fixes #134)
  * Fix "navigation-request" blocking, off-by-one error in C code
  * Fixes #138: persistent follow mode persisting too well
  * .gitignore luakit.1.gz
  * Cleanup patch
  * Add option to specify exact download filename (paired with suggested fn)
  * Add mkaito to authors
  * Add option to store session cookies in db (closes #154)
  * Make sure `query_delete_expired` doesn't delete session cookies (#154)
  * Remove inaccuracies from AUTHORS & COPYING files, correct wording.
  * Fix typo, luakit icon should be 0644
  * Remove deprecated `g_thread_init` usage.
    From the docs:
      `g_thread_init` has been deprecated since version 2.32 and should not
      be used in newly-written code. This function is not longer necessary.
      The GLib threading system is automatically initialized at the start of
      your program.
  * Change behaviour of middle-click navigation, ignore multi-line "urls"
    Rationale: The previous behaviour was extremely annoying for people (me)
    using luakit on laptops with sensitive track-pads when two-finger
    scrolling. Occasionally while two-finger scrolling a middle-click will
    register causing people (me) to lose page position, state and form data.
  * Fix indent.
  * Update the [pP]* bind comments.
  * Move Control+Enter binding into the add_cmds block.
    - Use shorter variable names
    - inline the .com value
    - add a binding comment (viewable in :help)

  [ Ambrevar ]
  * Man page: first issue Description, Options, Keybindings, Commands, Files,
    Configuration. help2man is no more required, hence the removal from
    README.md. Changed Makefile to generate the manpage and install it properly
  * Man page: polished first issue.
  * Manpage: removed non-default binding.

  [ Michishige Kaito ]
  * Check for suggested_filename in opts table.
    If the opts table contains a key suggested_filename,
    it will override the one that webkit would provide
    based on uri and headers. The suggested file name will
    be passed down to signals for further processing, just
    like the one webkit suggests.
  * Removed encodeURI from the file name display.
    The uri needs to be escaped in internal fields, but for
    display purposes, it's garbage.
  * Download chrome now displays file size stats
  * Size info on finished downloads

  [ eshizhan ]
  * Fix input non-English word error (closes #150)

  [ Bartłomiej Piotrowski ]
  * The icon shouldn't be executable

  [ Daniel Bolgheroni ]
  * Typo.
  * Home goes to top, End goes to end.

  [ Plaque-fcc ]
  * Fix mason-larobina/luakit#135.
  * Fix mason-larobina/luakit#135.

  [ Robbie Smith ]
  * Added PKGBUILD and .install for Arch Linux.
    Modified PKGBUILD so that configuration files won’t be overwritten on
    update.
  * Added fix for Issue #200.
    Another option is to hardcode the architecture, but that is somewhat
    less flexible.
  * Fixed PKGBUILD issues.
  * Modified yank/paste bindings to include clipboard.
    Also has logical support for tabs and windows. Lower-case binds use
    primary selection, upper-case binds use clipboard.
    * `pp` / `PP` Open in current tab
    * `pt` / `PT` Open in [count=1] new tab(s)
    * `pw` / `PW` Open in new window

  [ nmeum ]
  * Document globals.term used by formfiller to determine terminal emulator

  [ Robbie ]
  * Update PKGBUILD.
    Removed my local build source line.

  [ walt ]
  * Fixed click() in follow.lua to trigger more events.
    Only 'click' doesn't work for all elements

  [ Aidan Holm ]
  * Implement linear smooth scrolling
  * Add GtkPaned position getter + setter
  * Add widget wdth/height getters.
    Since the label widget uses the 'width' property to get the text width in
    characters, this has been moved to to the 'textwidth' property.
  * Add bg property to box widget
  * Add missing widget width/height getter declarations
  * Define smooth scrolling functions in better order.
    Removes undeclared function warnings; actual body of both moved
    functions is the same
  * Fix scrolling on gtk2
  * Remove mouse forward/backward bindings
  * Add keybinds for help and web inspector
  * Clear user stylesheet when not in use
  * Make follow mode filtering case-insensitive
  * Add support for setting custom useragent
  * Add site_styles() helper function
  * Implement Lua remove_cookies()
  * Add initial profile support
  * Remove incorrect use of UNUSED macro
  * Fix compilation errors when using webkit1
  * Fix assertion failure when there's no history
  * Return boolean indicating history traversal success
  * Add label alignment for GTK >= 3.16.
    Now supported for GTK >= 3.16 and GTK < 3.14, which leaves an
    interesting gap in the middle...
    Are alignments merely deprecated for GTK 3.14, 3.15? If so, might as
    well use them since it's an old version anyway...
  * Correct label widget .width to .textwidth
  * Add CSS for chrome page h1 tags
  * Fix go_up on file:// URIs
  * Add adblock and adblock_chrome modules
  * Fix adblock parsing of || rules.
    Since Lua pattern matching doesn't support grouping, the previous
    conversion of the || domain-matching rule resulted in overly-eager
    patterns that would match any URL with a domain _ending with the
    specified domain name. For example, a rule ||bar.com would block
    foobar.com as well as foo.bar.com.
    In order to work around this limitation, abp_to_pattern now returns a
    table of patterns. Should the current rule be a ||-rule, two patterns
    will be returned; one which matches that domain exactly, and one that
    matches all subdomains.
  * Make adblock_chrome HTML easier to read
  * Make adblock_chrome use consistent CSS
  * Colour-code adblock_chrome enabled/disabled text
  * Add enable/disable button to adblock_chrome
  * Add links for easy adblock filter list toggling.
    This reverts commit 5e99d978d375e15bb8764bdac8632fa778066e2d.
  * Move adblock rule stats to adblock_chrome header
  * Improve adblock_chrome CSS
  * Don't adblock on local files
  * Correct typo nul -> nil
  * Optimize adblock domain name anchor rules.
    Previously, domain name anchor matches were made by using two Lua
    patterns, for matching the exact domain name and for matching subdomains
    respectively. This bloated the pattern lists.
    By storing domain name anchor rules in a table, we can very quickly
    retrieve matching rules since tables are backed by a hash-table. This
    dramatically increases performance on whitelisted URLs, and URLs which
    do not match any rule also take substantially less time to process,
    due to the large reduction in pattern matches.
    Rough testing showed a mean 58%, median 60% speed increase over the
    previous version, with more than 95% of queries receiving a speed
    increase of 35% or more.
  * adblock: skip matching data URIs.
    Data URI are often fairly long, and matching them seems to be causing
    long (2+ seconds) matching times due to their length. As a preemptive
    measure, skip matching them for now.
  * adblock: split blacklist patterns into two sets
    "ad", not surprisingly, tends to be a fairly common word in blacklisted
    patterns, occurring in roughly half the non-domain-anchored rules.
    Therefore, we can split the pattern set into those that contain "ad" and
    those that don't, then only test the former set if the URI contains "ad"
    as well.
    Assuming that many non-blacklisted web URIs don't contain the string
    "ad", testing these URIs should take roughly half the time. Of course,
    this strategy will have no effect on domains containing the string "ad",
    since all same-domain requests will take the full time.
    Unscientific testing seems to yield a mean 50% speed improvement on
    requests not containing the substring "ad".
  * Use table to display adblock lists
  * Improve adblock_chrome filter list display
  * adblock: Match simpler patterns with string.find()
    Rough testing showed a ~1.5x speed increase
  * adblock: refactor filter list parsing
  * adblock: refactor filter list matching
  * adblock: optimize plain matching wrt 'ad'
    Similar to how the list of patterns which require the URI to contain
    "ad" to match are skipped if the URI does not in fact contain "ad", we
    also group all plain strings to compare which have this requirement and
    skip comparison if possible.
  * adblock: refactor list length/ignore tally
  * Initial work on cookie filter module
  * Align action link right
  * Improve adblock chrome layout
  * Add mixed content blocker module.
    Automatically blocks requests to insecure content from secure pages.
    Page navigations are excluded from this; this is necessary to allow
    navigation to e.g. Google search results, where a secure Google page
    redirects to the insecure destination page.
    Temporarily enabling mixed content for a view can be done via a call
    to w:toggle_mixed_content().
    Tested with https://www.bennish.net/mixed-content.html
    Areas for improvement:
     - Memory leak: has_mixed and allow_mixed entries are not freed when
       views are closed
     - Not currently possible to query allow_mixed status for a view
     - allow_mixed status sticks until the view is closed; should perhaps be
       reset on page / domain navigation, possibly with a cache
     - No domain_props support
  * Allow accept-cookie hooks to accept per-session only
  * Add per-session cookie filtering support
  * Clean cookie_filter_chrome CSS
  * Fix stupid table index bug
  * Unblock window.open() for follow mode.
    Temporarily enabling window.open for the duration of the follow mode
    evaluator execution allows onclick=window.open(...) and similar links to
    be followed. Without this, such links work when clicked but not when
    followed.
    This *should* be secure enough
  * Add editor module
  * Use editor module in formfiller module
  * Use editor module in introspector module
  * Use consistent design for downloads_chrome
  * Refactor noscript, add widget/interface hooks
  * Remove URI validity assert (fails on about:blank)
  * Add shim for view:loading()
  * Fix compilation with webkit2
  * Add useless webkit web extension
  * Fix typo in noscript module
  * Add modeline to extension/main.c
  * Remove (apparent?) debugging logging
  * Add webkit2 token translation layer (fix noscript)
    Some property names changed; e.g. "enable-scripts" to "enable-javascript"
    This commit adds a translation layer so that e.g. noscript and other
    plugins can use the old names.
  * Move Javascript signal table entry
  * Fix memory leak in mixed_content.lua
  * Fix noscript URI nil test
  * Add unix socket between web and ui processes
  * Add user content manager to web view
  * Add global stylesheet set
  * Add per-view toggling of stylesheets
  * Fix hardcoded webkit extension dir
  * Add stylesheet Lua class and signal.
    Stylesheets can now be added from Lua code, which must specify the CSS
    source code to load. Lua code can change a stylesheet's source code, and
    the change will be reflected automatically.
    Stylesheets should be enabled/disabled for a view only in the stylesheet
    signal emitted on that view. TODO: add enforcement
    Lua code must maintain a list of stylesheets: this is by design to help
    ensure that separate regions of Lua code can each manage user stylesheets
    they add without inadvertently affecting the other.
  * Fix stylesheet signal handler timing.
    The view uri is not yet set during the provisional event, which makes
    matching stylesheets against the view URI challenging, to say the least.
    Delays the stylesheet signal until the load is committed.
  * Add web extension Lua state
  * Link common/*.c files into luakit.so
  * Correct Makefile dependancy
  * Add basic Lua dom_document class
  * Add basic Lua dom_element class
  * Set Lua panic function for web process
  * Isolate luaH_add_paths()
  * Move luaH_add_paths() into common/
  * Add Lua paths in web extension
  * Add web extension Lua require() message handler
  * Implement inter-process Lua modules and signals.
    This commit adds support for instantiating modules in the WebKit web
    process, as well as allowing signals to be sent from modules in the main
    UI Lua instance to modules running on the web process Lua instance, over
    the Unix socket.
    To accomplish this, two classes are defined; the web_module class, only
    available from UI process Lua, and the ui_process class, only available
    from web process Lua. A web_module instantiation require()s a module on
    the web thread, and subsequent emit_signal() and add_signal() calls work
    as usual.
  * Add basic Lua stack serialization for Lua IPC
  * Add support for serializing Lua tables.
    Note that attempting to serialize tables with cycles will blow the
    stack, and multiple references to the same items are not deduplicated
  * Add serialization to Lua inter-process signals
  * Set error function in web Lua
  * Add global access to WebExtension pointer
  * Fix extension target collection in Makefile
  * Add EXT_SRCS and EXT_OBJS to Makefile output
  * Remove excess Lua stack items in constructor
  * Add view.id getter and document(id) constructor
  * Refactor strcmp into token comparison
  * Add luaH_dom_element_from_node()
  * Clean up luaH_dom_document_push_body()
  * Add basic document element creation from Lua
  * Add element:query(selector)
  * Add Lua element:append(element)
  * Add initial implementation of pos/size retrieval
  * Add document and element libraries to Lua
  * Add element inner text initialization
  * Add element removal
  * Add element.tag_name getter
  * Add DOM element attribute access from Lua
  * Add DOM element click() and focus()
  * Add DOM element text_content property
  * Make element.rect always supply up-do-date valeus
  * Include element scroll offsets in position
  * Add basic document.window interface
  * Add remove_signals method to Lua objects
  * Add global web extension include
  * Remove some warnings in common/msg
  * More warning fixes in Lua DOM API
  * Warning removal
  * Update webview scroll interface for webkit2.
    There is no way to quicky find the current scroll information on the
    UI-thread; as a workaround, we listen to DOM events related to window
    resizing and scrolling and document resizing on the Web process, and
    send updated values to the UI thread. This method allows us to keep the
    old Lua scrolling interface. Currently this seems to perform well,
    even though the document height is recalculated on each DOM
    modification...
  * Add Lua window unique id property
  * Initial port of follow.lua.
    In WebKit 2, there is no way to access the JavaScript contexts of
    sub-frames, which makes it impossible to use the existing JS-based
    follow mode implementation. The WebKitDOM API, however, provides the
    access previously provided by JS. Therefore, a Lua wrapper in the form
    of the dom_document and dom_element classes has been implemented, and is
    used here to port follow mode to run on the WebKit Lua web process.
    This is more of a reimplementation than a port; some features behave
    slightly differently, some may not work perfectly yet, performance is
    probably sub-optimal initially, etc.
  * Oops... fix leftover reference
  * Fix incorrect create_cb() parameters
  * Fix copy-paste mangled comment
  * Add luakit.webkit2 property
  * Fix noscript.lua for Webkit 2
  * Enable JS temporarily for scrolling
  * Fix Lua stack memory leak
  * Remove useless leave() call in follow_webmodule
  * Add luauniq registry system
  * Fix leftover items on Lua stack
  * Add Lua object <-> gobject binding mechanism
  * Don't send useless document resize messages
  * Add DOM element style property getter
  * Hide follow hints for invisible elements
  * Ensure uniqueness of DOM element instances
  * Don't barf on nested table serialization
  * Clean up assertions
  * Fix IO channel error handling
  * Tell web process when config has loaded
  * Add page and extension Lua classes
  * Port adblock module to webkit2.
    Instead of listening to the navigation-request signal, which fires after
    the request has begun, we listen to the send-request signal on the web
    process, which fires before the request begins; the difference is vital
    when blocking tracking URLs.
    The rule parsing and UI remain the same; when the rule tables are
    updated, they are sent to the web module over the IPC channel. This
    doesn't appear to affect startup time adversely at all, since the
    serialized rules table (for my lists) currently clocks in at around 4 Mb.
  * Reduce serialized Lua size.
    Using int8 instead of int for type markers reduces transfer size by 17%
    for my adblock rule set.
  * Fix luakit:// scheme handler crash
  * Fix introspector not displaying
  * Add DOM element src, href, parent getters
  * Fix some follow mode bugs
  * Add chrome.lua on_first_visual hook.
    Lots of chrome pages have a hook that runs once when the webview has
    finished loading, usually in order to export JS functions. These are all
    implemented in the same copy-pasteish way, so unifying this simplifies a
    fair amount of code.
    I'm a little unhappy with how chrome.add() takes two functions with the
    same signature... could also do with some small wrappers for the webview:
    view:register_functions() and view:load_js_library() could cut back code
    size.
  * Add DOM element inner_html getter/setter
  * Remove unneeded check in ui_process library
  * Actually show chrome error tracebacks
  * Tidy chrome error HTML
  * Allow mix of pos/neg indices in Lua serializer.
    The lua_serialize_range() call was replaced to avoid needless
    conversions when serializing large tables, such as the adblock rule
    table.
  * luaH_absindex; keep zero as zero
  * fixup_5d12eeb
  * Allow valid Lua deserialization of nothing
  * Declare message types as powers of two
  * Move Lua (de)serializing to separate files
  * Include JS directly in introspector HTML
  * Add missing attributes to introspector markup.
    Clicking them still doesn't work though... well, not in this branch
    anyway
  * Allow delaying IPC message handling via type mask.
    Currently, the grand plan is to add support for exporting Lua functions
    to JavaScript; since these functions must now run on the web process in
    WebKit 2, and current uses often require returning values to JavaScript
    (and not mere value passing to Lua), the only viable solution seems to
    be to send an IPC message to the UI process, which executes the Lua
    function, and block while waiting for a response.
    In the interest of not blocking the web process for too long, and just
    generally retaining our sanity, we need to ignore all other messages
    while we wait for the reply containing the value to return to JS. The
    last thing we need is to start loading some web module or running some
    web Lua signal handler while we're blocking the whole process.
    This commit supports that; unwanted messages are added to a queue and
    dispatched later.
  * Unify some common message handling stuff
  * Clean up msg_recv_scroll() warnings
  * Dispatch queued messages on idle
  * Support (de)serializing light userdata

  * Uncomment web_page constructor
  * Remove unused variable
  * Follow mode: clip overlay of inline elements
  * Follow mode: remove print() spam
  * Remove unused JavaScript scrolling function
  * Fix conflation of inspector signal names
  * Fix webkit2 inspector.
    For WebKit 2, the inspector basically just works, and from the API it
    doesn't seem like there's all that much you can do with it anyway. The
    documentation makes some mention of getting a GtkWidget but of course
    completely fails to specify how one might do so.
    The iview parameter is now useless, and it's been replaced with a
    boolean inspector_open property.
  * Clean up warning
  * Fix incorrect return value check causing segfault
  * Remove view.history for WebKit 2
  * Remove view.show_scrollbars for WebKit 2
  * Replace deprecated function
  * Add widget_set_css()
  * Add widget_set_css_properties()
  * Update widget CSS instead of replacing it
  * Remove deprecated function in widgets/label.c
  * Remove deprecated function in widgets/box.c
  * Remove deprecated function in widgets/entry.c
  * Remove deprecated function in widgets/eventbox.c
  * Fix segfault on JS exception with callback
  * Remove view:loading() deprecated spam.
    Although new code _should_ use is_loading, it doesn't matter all that
    much. Plus this is filling up my terminal window and it's been a little
    irritating, so out it goes.
  * Swap out asprintf for g_strdup_printf
  * Remove print call in scrolling.
    No idea how that snuck in there...
  * Fix link-unhover signal not being emitted
  * Hack search so it works... probably.
    Honestly this whole bit of code is kind of hairy and this may be a
    little buggy, but from rough testing this commit should make it work the
    same as with WebKit1; it was completely broken before anyway so it's a
    step in the right direction.
  * Work around userscripts not loading
  * Report source in JavaScript error messages
  * Rename 'load-changed' to 'load-status' (compat)
    Although the signal name from WebKit has changed, there's no need to
    change the signal name for Lua, since the signal semantics are the same,
    with the exception of the first-visual update, which is never sent for
    WebKit 2.
  * Don't send load-status finished after failed (compat)
  * Rename load-failed to load-status failed (compat)
  * Fix view:load_string() when called from load_failed_cb()
    Using the regular load_html() call in a load-status failed signal
    handler causes luakit to get stuck in a loop if you reload the page
    while it is already reloading. Switching to load_alternate_html() fixes
    that case.
  * Add signals for per-view js/plugin override
  * Add styles library
  * Add error page library.
    Allows customization of the luakit error page. Disables custom
    stylesheets and enables javascript when showing an error page; the
    former to prevent per-page CSS mangling the error page, and the latter
    to ensure the retry button works
    Also improves upon the default WebKit error page somewhat; centres the
    box, improves margins/paddings somewhat, and darkens the background
    slightly.
  * Require error-page and styles by default
  * Fix broken conditional in noscript.lua
  * Add uri check in get_domain()
  * Add WITH_WEBKIT2 check
  * Make registering functions work in WebKit 1 again
  * Fix compilation error for WebKit 1

  * Add dom_element.checked
  * Add dom_element.type
  * Start port of formfiller
  * Fix incorrect argument order
  * Move check for empty/null uri
  * Add JS regex -> Lua pattern conversion step.
    This is very hacky and I'm sure it's easy to find patterns that break
    this. The idea is to have a quick fix that lets me use both WebKit1
    and WebKit 2 builds, although this conversion step should eventually be
    fleshed out, or removed entirely.

    Previously, the socket file was created and removed with each connection

    they attempted to connect to a socket which wasn't present on disk. This
    resulted in tabs occasionally failing to load.
    Now, a single socket is opened and kept open for the duration of the
    program.

  * Fix scroll widget sometimes crashing web process.
    Some websites monkey with the Object prototype, which can make all

  * Reexec luakit on config failure.
    Loading a config file can fail at any point, leaving luakit in a messy
    state. Rather than try to clean up the application state, we just reexec
    luakit, which is simple and robust.
  * Revert "Recreate Lua state when config fails to load"
    This reverts commit abaedee147a3c07c383caf889196424f4aca5fc9.
  * fixup! Reexec luakit on config failure
  * Don't delete session file if config load fails
  * restart: check current config for syntax errors
  * theme: add menu row state colors
  * styles: Add initial implementation of menu
  * styles: persist stylesheet state into DB
  * styles-menu: indicate active styles
  * styles: refactor menu updating a little
  * styles: add edit-stylesheet menu binding
  * menu: remove required ncols state from rows
  * styles: more refactoring
  * error_page: require use of custom URI schemes.
    External use of show_error_page() now requires a request object, which
    requires use of a custom scheme. This change is used because the
    alternative would be to completely replace the currently loaded page,
    which seems impossible without mangling the view history.
  * webview: add go-back-forward signal
  * error_page: correctly intercept enable- signals
  * styles: fix parsing of stylesheets with global rules
  * styles: add 'Affects' column to styles-list
  * webview: add modify_load_block() API (#285)
    This API allows Lua modules to add/remove named blocks from a webview.
    If a webview is blocked, it will queue navigations (only those via
    webview.set_location() and whatever calls that) and dispatch them later.
    The view URI will appear to update immediately, however, due to some
    metatable trickery that'd be nice to remove.
  * session: load restored tabs ony after focus (#115)

  * fixes aidanholm/luakit#358
  * clean target rule now removes luakit.1.gz and luakit.so, then fixes #365
  * install target rule depends now on the all target, then fixes #363
    this complies with the Debian recommandations
  * This fixes #368
  * Revert "makefile: add default target"
    See #359 for details that explain why the 'default' target is a nonsens as
    there is the 'all' target already existing.
    This reverts commit ece896913e46069bb1d9b044d21d4b16824c34fb.
  * Makefile 'default' target is deprecated. Use target 'all' as a replacement.
    Keep 'default' target to ensure retro-compatibility, so let it sounds
    as .PHONY target
  * Widely use 'install' commands instead of several and sparse commands
    like 'cp' or 'chmod'. This is to ensure homogenity and comply with
    Debian precepts.
    This fixes #371
  * Remove executability check on 'luakit.so' from 'ipc.c'
    This fixes #384
  * Debianization
